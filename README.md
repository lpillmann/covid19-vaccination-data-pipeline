# covid19-vaccination-data-pipeline
Main repository for Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree Capstone Project - COVID-19 Vaccination in Brazil.

## Overview
This project implements an automated data pipeline to ingest and model vaccination data from the Brazilian government.

### Data sources
Two data sources are used:
- **Vaccinations**: National Covid-19 Vaccination Campaign. Source: Brazilian Ministry of Health. Format: API ([link](https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/covid-19-vacinacao)).
- **Population**: 2020 Brazilian census. Source: [IBGE](https://www.ibge.gov.br/), data treated and shared by Álvaro Justen/[Brasil.IO](https://brasil.io/). Format: CSV ([link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turicas/covid19-br/master/covid19br/data/populacao-por-municipio-2020.csv)).

### Data modeling

The output of the pipeline is a dimensional model comprised of one fact table for **vaccinations** and dimensions for **patients**, **facilities**, **vaccines**, **cities**, **cities** and **calendar**.

This structure enables answering questions such as:

- Which states/cities present the best vaccination per capta?
- How is the vaccination pace evolving over time?
- How many vaccinations are being applied daily in Brazil?
    - Breakdown by state, city, gender, age group, so on
- What vaccines are being applied?
    - Breakdown by manufacturer, type, etc
- How many people are still left to be vaccinated?

#### Example analyses
The charts below were built using the dimensional model produced by the pipeline. Below each chart is the query used, for reference.

### Pipeline
Below is the overview of the pipeline:
![Pipeline diagram](./images/pipeline-diagram.png)

The data pipeline was automated using Airflow. It is comprised of four major steps:
1. **Extract data from the sources to S3**: for vaccinations API this is done using the [Singer standard](https://www.singer.io/). The [Open Data SUS tap](https://github.com/lpillmann/tap-opendatasus) was developed from scratch as part of the project. The [S3 CSV target](https://github.com/lpillmann/pipelinewise-target-s3-csv) was adapted from existing one. For the population data, a standalone Shell script was used. Airflow `BashOperator` was used to run the extractions.
1. **Load data from S3 to Redshift**: use of `COPY` statement with custom built operators (`CopyCsvToRedshiftOperator` and `CopyCsvToRedshiftPartionedOperator`).
1. **Transform data into dimensional model**: transformations were done using SQL on top of Redshift, using layers of processing (`raw`, `staging` and `dimensional`) and the custom built operator `RedshiftQueryOperator`.
1. **Data quality checks**: implemented using SQL with custom operator `DataQualityOperator` that compares the test query result with the expected value provided by the user.

Below is the graph view of the DAG:

And here is the Gantt view of a complete execution:

## Setup instructions
### Infrastructure
Install local Python env
```bash
make install-infra
```

Define the following enviroment variables
```bash
# Tip: add this snippet to your bash profile (e.g. ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc if you use ZSH)
export UDACITY_AWS_KEY="..."
export UDACITY_AWS_SECRET="..."
export UDACITY_AWS_REGION="..."
export UDACITY_AWS_PROFILE="..."
export UDACITY_CAPSTONE_PROJECT_BUCKET="my-bucket"
export UDACITY_REDSHIFT_HOST="my-host.something-else.redshift.amazonaws.com"
export UDACITY_REDSHIFT_DB_NAME="..."
export UDACITY_REDSHIFT_DB_USER="..."
export UDACITY_REDSHIFT_DB_PASSWORD="..."
export UDACITY_REDSHIFT_DB_PORT="..."
export AIRFLOW_UID=1000
export AIRFLOW_GID=0
```

Create Redshift cluster
```bash
make create-cluster
```

>When finished using the cluster, remember to delete it to avoid unexpected costs:
>
>Delete Redshift Cluster
>```bash
>make delete-cluster
>```


### Airflow
Airflow was configured using Docker following [this reference](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/docker.html#running-airflow).

Build customized image:
```bash
make image
```

Start Airflow services:
```bash
make airflow
```

Open UI at [http://localhost:8080/home](http://localhost:8080/home) using login credentials as user `airflow` and password `airflow`.

> Note 1: this Airflow setup is for development purposes. For production deployment some additional configurations would be needed (see [this reference](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/production-deployment.html)).

> Note 2: some Airflow environment variables were customized in `docker-compose.yaml`, namely:
>```bash
>AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES: 'false'  # don't load dag examples
>AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__RELOAD_ON_PLUGIN_CHANGE: 'true'  # reload plugins as soon as they are saved
>AIRFLOW_CONN_REDSHIFT: postgres://...  # custom connection URI using the env vars instead of using UI
>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${UDACITY_AWS_KEY}
>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${UDACITY_AWS_SECRET}
>AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: ${UDACITY_AWS_REGION}
>UDACITY_AWS_PROFILE: ${UDACITY_AWS_PROFILE}
>UDACITY_CAPSTONE_PROJECT_BUCKET: ${UDACITY_CAPSTONE_PROJECT_BUCKET}
>```

## Notes
1. Not all Brazilian states are covered. Just a few were selected to use as an example. They amount to over 15 million rows in the fact table which fulfills the Udacity project requirement of 1 million.
1. A custom Airflow image was created to enable having a second Python installation in the container. This was needed to run the tap and target without conflicts with Airflow's main one.
1. The DAG was left without schedule, since it was manually triggered during development. The suggested schedule to run in production would be `@daily`.
1. A partitioned load approach by `year_month` and `state_abbrev` is implemented and can be used in case of daily runs. For development purposes only the load all operator was used since the Redshift cluster was recreated every time.
1. The Vaccinations API uses Elasticsearch as engine. The developed tap made use of ES client libraries to enable easier interaction with the endpoints.


### Future work
These are some of the further improvements that can be made to the project:
- Change incremental extractions to be daily instead of monthly to reduce total execution time (currently around 30 minutes)
- Simplify `DataQualityOperator` usage by providing predefined tests (e.g. uniqueness, not null, etc)
- Clean DAG definition by using default arguments more wisely

## Addressing other scenarios
- **The data was increased by 100x**. The expected impact would be the DAG taking 100x longer to finish, mostly due to the extract step which is the bottleneck. A possible approach to compensate the longer duration would be partitioning and paralelizing the load using some other attribute such as `city`, `day` or `hour` - currently the data is partitioned by `year_month` and `state_abbrev`. The choice of new partitions or incremental criteria would depend on how the data increased (e.g. more events per day? More cities performing vaccinations? More attributes about each event?)
- **The pipelines would be run on a daily basis by 7 am every day**. The DAG is already implemented having a daily schedule in mind. For example, the extraction is done only for the latest `year_month` and the `CopyCsvToRedshiftPartionedOperator` is available to load only a specific partition (it is currenly commented). So the only change would be setting the schedule parameter and uncommenting this operator to be used for the vaccinations data.
- **The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people**. In order to support such demand, Redshift cluster configuration would need to be changed. Specifically, the number of nodes would be increased and, depending on the load, their sizes would need to be increased as well.
